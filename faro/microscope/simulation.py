    """Simulated microscope behind a pymmcore-plus ``UniMMCore``.

    Works with any pure-Python core that exposes a camera, a channel group
    and optionally an SLM, e.g. ``vmteach.load_microscope(...)``. The SLM is
    wrapped in the same :class:`faro.core.dmd.DMD` as on the real scopes, so
    the calibration routine, the affine transform and the stim event path
    are exercised exactly as in an experiment: call ``calibrate_dmd`` before
    running stim events (the simulated projector is aligned by default, and
    ``sim.slm_affine`` models a misaligned one).
