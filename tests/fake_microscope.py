"""Drop-in ``PyMMCoreMicroscope`` backed by a real ``UniMMCore`` + Python devices.

The Controller drives the Python devices through the real pymmcore-plus
MDA engine, so tests exercise actual ``mmc.run_mda``, the ``frameReady``
signal chain, ``setSLMImage`` / ``displaySLMImage`` dispatch, and
``validate_hardware`` queries.

Usage::

    scene = MyScene(...)
    mic = FakeMicroscope(scene)
    ctrl = Controller(mic, pipeline)
    ctrl.run_experiment(events)

Scene-specific state lives on ``mic.scene``.
