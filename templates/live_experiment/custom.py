"""Components specific to this experiment.

Put the segmentator, feature extractor or stimulator that only this
experiment needs here and import them in the notebook's pipeline cell:

    from custom import MySegmentator, MyFeatureExtractor, MyStimulator

Keep them out of notebook cells so the re-analysis notebook can import the
same classes and so they can be tested. Once a class is needed by a second
experiment, move it into faro and pin the commit that has it.
